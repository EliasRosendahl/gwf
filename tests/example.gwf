Example of a simple workflow. Everything before the first upcode (@)
is considered a comment/documentation of the workflow and is not
interpreted by gwf.

@target echo
# everything from here to the next @ is considered a shell script.
echo "hello, world!"

@target cat
:input example.gwf
cat example.gwf

@target touch
:output foo
touch foo
