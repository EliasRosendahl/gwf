Editor Support: Visual Studio Code
==================================


We currently provide two snippets in ``snippets.json``:

* targ: defines a target given a specification,
* tmpl: defines a target from a template.

To use the snippets, open your snippets file by choosing **User Snippets** under **File > Preferences**
(**Code > Preferences** on Mac) and select ``Python``. Copy-paste the contents of ``snippets.json`` into the file that
is opened and save.
