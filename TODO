FEATURES

 - There's currently no propper error handling. If you are lucky, an
   assertion is broking and the script is terminated. To make this
   useful, a lot more error checking and error handling is needed.

 - The testing is pretty shitty as well. I have just been testing
   while writing the code. I need some properly thought out tests to
   make sure this doesn't bite me at some point...

 - Add some nicer scripts for displaying workflows and the jobs that
   will be run for a given task.
