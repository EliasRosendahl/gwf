Welcome to gwf
==============

*gwf* is a flexible, pragmatic workflow tool for building and running large,
scientific workflows developed at the Bioinformatics Research Centre
(BiRC), Aarhus University.

To quickly get started with writing workflows in *gwf* you can read the
:ref:`tutorial`. If you want to extend *gwf* you should read
:ref:`writing_plugins`. We don't have the backend you need to run your workflow
on your cluster? See the :ref:`writing_backends` section!

Installation
------------

To install *gwf* via pip just run::

    pip install gwf

Or via conda::

    conda install gwf

You can find the code `here <https://github.com/mailund/gwf>`_.
