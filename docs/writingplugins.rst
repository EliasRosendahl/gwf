Writing Plugins
===============

Plugins can manipulate and control the entire workflow and its execution. Thus,
quite complex things can be implemented with plugins. Actually, much of the
main functionality of *gwf* is implemented through plugins! In this tutorial
we will implement a plugin that prints the names of all targets in the workflow.

A plugin is a Python package and thus you should be (at least slightly)
familiar with the principles of packaging in Python. If you're not, don't worry.
This guide will teach you the basics.

Plugins for *gwf* must inherit from :class:`gwf.plugins.Plugin` and
implement the required methods and specify the :attr:`name` attribute. Thus,
a minimal (and completely useless) plugin looks like this::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):
        pass

Registering a Plugin
----------------------

This plugin does nothing, but let's try to hook it up to *gwf*. Plugins are
registered with *gwf* through entry points specified in `setup.py`, so we have
to write a `setup.py` file for our plugin::

    # myplugin/setup.py
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name="myplugin",
        version="0.0.1",
        py_modules=['myplugin'],
        install_requires=[
          'gwf>=1.0',
        ],
        entry_points={
            'gwf.plugins': [
                'myplugin = myplugin:MyPlugin',
            ]
        },
    )

Here we register our plugin under the `gwf.plugins` entrypoint. This means that
*gwf* will be able to automatically locate and load our plugin (*gwf* looks
for all entry points registered under the `gwf.plugins` identifier). Since the
plugin is written for *gwf*, we also specify that our package requires at least
version 1.0 of *gwf*.

Installation and Sanity Check
-----------------------------

We can now install our plugin by running `python setup.py develop`. We install
the plugin in development mode so that we can quickly test changes.

When the installation has completed we can check whether *gwf* can find and
load the plugin by running `gwf -b testing -v debug` (you must do this in a
directory containing a `workflow.py` file containing a valid workflow).

You should see something like this::

    DEBUG |  Platform: Darwin-16.0.0-x86_64-i386-64bit.
    DEBUG |  GWF version: 1.0.0.
    DEBUG |  Python version: 3.5.2.
    DEBUG |  Node: Dans-Mac-mini.local.
    DEBUG |  Python path: ['/Users/das/Code/gwf/examples/minimal-workflow', ...]
    DEBUG |  Loaded plugins: logs, run, config, myplugin.
    DEBUG |  Loaded backends: testing, slurm.
    DEBUG |  Setting active backend: testing.
    DEBUG |  Loading workflow from: examples/minimal-workflow/workflow.py.
    ...

Some of the output has been cut away, but you should be able to locate
`myplugin` in the list of loaded plugins.

.. note::
  The observant reader may have noticed that there are several plugins included
  with *gwf*, namely the `logs`, `run` and `config` plugins that provide the
  `logs`, `run` and `config` commands, respectively. In short, we eat our own
  dog food!

Adding a Subcommand
-------------------

So now our plugin is loaded by *gwf*, but it doesn't do anything. Let's set up
a subcommand that the user can run to get a list of all targets in the
current workflow. Plugins have a special hook to set up the argument parsing:

.. automethod::
  gwf.plugins.Plugin.setup_argument_parser
  :noindex:

We can override this method to add our subcommand as follows::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):

        def setup_argument_parser(self, parser, subparsers):
            subparser = self.setup_subparser(
                subparsers,
                'print-targets',
                'A command for printing the name of all targets.',
                self.on_run,
            )

        def on_run(self):
            print('hello!')

Here we use the helper method :func:`setup_subparser` to
hook up the ``on_run`` method to the subcommand. Running ``gwf -h`` should now
list the ``print-targets`` subcommand and running ``gwf print-targets`` should
print ``hello!`` to the screen.

Accessing the Workflow
----------------------

Now we just need to get a list of all targets in the workflow and print their
names. Plugins are by default configured with three attributes: :attr:`backend`,
:attr:`config`, and :attr:`workflow`. The :attr:`workflow` attribute contains a
:class:`~gwf.PreparedWorkflow` which has a :attr:`targets` attribute. We can use
this to look up all targets in the workflow::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):

        def setup_argument_parser(self, parser, subparsers):
            subparser = self.setup_subparser(
                subparsers,
                'print-targets',
                'A command for printing the name of all targets.',
                self.on_run,
            )

        def on_run(self):
            for target_name in self.workflow.targets.keys():
                print(target_name)


Voil√†! We now have a functioning plugin that prints a list of all targets in
the workflow.

Adding and Using Command Arguments
----------------------------------

Let's add an argument to our subcommand that the user can ask to only have
targets printed if they have been submitted. This will require us to interact
with the active backend.

First we'll add the argument to our subcommand::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):

        def setup_argument_parser(self, parser, subparsers):
            subparser = self.setup_subparser(
                subparsers,
                'print-targets',
                'A command for printing the name of all targets.',
                self.on_run,
            )

            subparser.add_argument(
                '-s',
                '--only-submitted',
                action='store_true',
                help='only list submitted targets.',
            )

        def on_run(self):
            for target_name in self.workflow.targets.keys():
                print(target_name)

In the :func:`on_run` we can access all settings and arguments given to *gwf*
through :attr:`self.config` which is a simple dictionary mapping option names
to their values. The active backend is accessed through :attr:`self.backend`.
Now let's combine the two in our plugin::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):

        def setup_argument_parser(self, parser, subparsers):
            subparser = self.setup_subparser(
                subparsers,
                'print-targets',
                'A command for printing the name of all targets.',
                self.on_run,
            )

            subparser.add_argument(
                '-s',
                '--only-submitted',
                action='store_true',
                help='only list submitted targets.',
            )

        def on_run(self):
            only_submitted = self.config['only_submitted']
            for target_name, target in self.workflow.targets.items():
                if only_submitted:
                    if self.backend.submitted(target):
                        print(target_name)
                else:
                    print(target_name)

Now, when the user runs ``gwf -b testing print-targets`` the name of all targets in the
workflow will be printed. If the user runs
``gwf -b testing print-targets --only-submitted`` only targets that have been
submitted will be shown (the testing backend never submits any targets, so
it will say that none of the targets have been submitted and give an empty
list).

Logging from a Plugin
---------------------

Logging is used to show messages to the user and write out debug messages. It's
good practice to create a logger instance for your plugin so that messages can
be filtered and printed based on the plugin. We'll create a logger instance
and use it to log a debugging message for our plugin like this::

    # myplugin/myplugin.py
    import logging

    from gwf.plugins import Plugin

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):

        def setup_argument_parser(self, parser, subparsers):
            subparser = self.setup_subparser(
                subparsers,
                'print-targets',
                'A command for printing the name of all targets.',
                self.on_run,
            )

            subparser.add_argument(
                '-s',
                '--only-submitted',
                action='store_true',
                help='only list submitted targets.',
            )

        def on_run(self):
            only_submitted = self.config['only_submitted']
            logger.debug('Only submitted was set to: %s.', only_submitted)
            for target_name, target in self.workflow.targets.items():
                if only_submitted:
                    if self.backend.submitted(target):
                        print(target_name)
                else:
                    print(target_name)

Running ``gwf -b testing print-targets`` will not show anything since the
default for *gwf* is to only show messages with a priority of warning or higher.
However, if set the verbosity level with ``-v debug`` the message will be
printed.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

In *gwf* all arguments that can be set on the command line can also be specified
in a configuration file. This means that the user can specify defaults for e.g.
which backend to use, the verbosity etc. The arguments defined by our plugin
are also automatically read from the configuration file, so if the user always
only wants to show submitted targets, the user can create a ``.gwf`` file in
the workflow directory (or the user directory) with the following contents::

    # .gwf
    only-submitted = true

Examples
--------

The plugins included with *gwf* are good examples of the kind of functionality
that can be implemented through plugins. You can find them
`here <https://github.com/mailund/gwf/tree/master/gwf/plugins>`_.
