*gwf* is a flexible, pragmatic workflow tool for building and running large,
scientific workflows. It runs on Python 3.5+ and is developed at the Bioinformatics
Research Centre (BiRC), Aarhus University.

Examples
  To get a feeling for what a *gwf* workflow looks like, have a look at a few
  `examples <https://github.com/mailund/gwf/tree/master/examples>`_.

Getting started
  To quickly get started writing workflows in *gwf* you can read the
  `tutorial`_.

Extending
  We don't have the backend you need to run your workflow on your cluster?
  See the `writingbackends`_ section to roll your own.

Contributing
  We aim to make *gwf* a community developed project. Learn how to
  `contribute`_.
